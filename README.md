# Intention Timer
###
Intention Timer is a site where you can pursue personal growth and keep track of your accomplishments through manageable chunks of time and focused activity. Fill out the form with your intentions and solely concentrate on your task at hand.

Intention Timer was built with Atom and GitHub, based on a static comp provided by Turing School of Software Design.

## Project Status
###
The project has made it through 5 iterations and has been tested for bugs, which have been addressed. Some additional features could be implemented including activity reflections, pausing the timer, favorites and re-dos. More thorough testing would be needed before product launch.

## Reflection
###
Intention Timer was completed by [Keith Crofton](https://github.com/KeithCrofton), [Derek Romero](https://github.com/dereklromero13) and [Greyson Elkins](https://www.github.com/GreysonElkins). It was an exploration in working with the DOM, functions over time, and local storage. We also got a lot of practice in HTML and CSS and responsive layout.  

The clock in particular forced us to do a lot of research and utilize new concepts. In addition to working with scope and `setInteval()` we exercised quite a bit of logic to navigate between strings and numbers and teach JavaScript to understand minutes and seconds. We made sure to continually test the functionality of the site as we built it, and managed to include elements which prevent errors (such as the clock returning NaN when receiving unexpected inputs or the user being able to refresh and log incomplete activities).
